### Lukas Autoencoder Code Readme

Use ```Far Stack Preprocessing.ipynb``` and ```Near Stack Preprocessing.ipynb``` to create the flattened horizon dataset.

Use ```UMAP Analysis and Fluid Factor.ipynb``` to perform UMAP analysis from day 1.

Use ```AVO-VAE-Step49.ipynb``` to perform analysis of Variational Autoencoder Output.

To create Autoencoder architecture use ```VAE Architecture Test.ipynb```.

Model trained using ```vae.py``` results output by using ```vae_synthetics.py```.

Epoch used was epoch 49. Ran with default settings.

Original code for VAE modified form https://github.com/wanglouis49/pytorch-autoencoders/blob/master/conv_vae.py.
